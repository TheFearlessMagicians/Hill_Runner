# Why this app?
We aim to bridge two groups people: people who are strapped for cash and those that needs help. We make outsourcing help easy, and also make it fun to run errands, making helping others enjoyable.

This is an extra hand for people who donâ€™t have a lot of time doing errands on the hill, and encourage the spirit of helping each other out. At the same time, there are lucrative financial incentives for the person who does the errands.

# How does it work?
There are two players in the game:
## Quest assigner (user)
They assign quests to hillrunners to deliver items to them (or other errands). Upon completion (or after assigning the quest), they give the hillrunners the money that they used to acquire the items, and a service fee.
## Hillrunner
The hillrunner completes quests set by quest assigner, and gain monetary rewards from the app as they level up.

# The flow:
1. Quest assigner assigns thing to be bought or task to be done.
2.  Hillrunner receives the **quest**, and has a time limit to complete it and deliver it back to the quest assigner.
3.  The quest assigner will venmo/pay the hillrunner for his service and an additional charge fee taking account the distance travelled, time taken, etc. by the hillrunner.

# Benefits:
## for Hillrunner
* Cash reward whenever they get accomplish orders
* They will level up as they accomplish orders, and as this happens, MORE monetary reward will be given to them.

## For quest assigner
* On-demand delivery service, may be fast because hillrunners could be near the target location when they get the task.
